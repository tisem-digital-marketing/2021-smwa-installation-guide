    * If everything goes smoothly, you should be able to complete the installation in one sitting which should take about 1 hour.
    * Please follow the steps one-by-one in the order they appear on the side bar and do not deviate from them, unless you really know what you are doing.
    * If you find any outdated links or unclear descriptions, email us at [tisem.social.media@gmail.com]() so that we can update the instructions or clarify as needed.

!!! bug "the `$` sign"

    In the pages that follow you will often see the following:

    ```bash
    $ someCommand 
    ```

    that ask you to enter into a terminal. 
    When you copy this command, do not include the `$` sign.
